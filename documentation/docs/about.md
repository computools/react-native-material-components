# React Native Material Components

This library provides a set of React Native components inspired by ```Material UI``` and based on the ```Material 3 Design Kit```. The components are crafted using Figma designs from the official Material Design Kit, which is available [here](https://www.figma.com/design/60rEc74mbCUjr5eBJlq7Cg/Material-3-Design-Kit-(Community)?node-id=11-1833&p=f&t=NHDhn0KrqqL7wE7O-0).

The library focuses on delivering an elegant, design-driven UI experience for React Native applications. All components reflect the latest Material Design principles but do not include built-in accessibility features. As this is primarily a design implementation, developers should customize accessibility features based on their specific requirements.

For more information on the correct usage of Material components and to explore the base principles, please visit the [Material UI Library](https://m3.material.io/).
